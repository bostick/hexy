physics
✓ FIX jumping around! Log out OnTriggerExit, OnCollisionExit, and all others? Need to debug!!!



add terrain
✓ recreate the Mathematica notebook for generating terrain
make a level editor?



✓ add more BoxColliders and make bucket into an actual bucket
✓ touching pickups turns them into physics objects
✓ must drop off pickups into a circle in the middle of the level



add enemy
✓ make a prefab for common between player and enemy
✓ make sure prefab has colliders for everything
✓ fix negative box colliders

a little explosion when pickups are dropped into portal




add sound fx
music
engine idling
tracks driving
backing up beep?
platform  rotating
boom moving
stick moving

## Graphics issues:
warning when building:
Warning! Using antialiasing on a mobile device may decrease performance severely. You can change the mobile quality settings in 'Project Settings -> Quality Settings'.
do we want antialiasing?


bad shadows:
flickering?
I tried lowering the far plane to 600 from 1000. Maybe helped?
remove shadows and use projector instead? what are projectors?
ideas for fixing shadows:
   turn off shadows for all meshes except for boom, stick, bucket
   use projector for pickups?


skybox?
night time?
